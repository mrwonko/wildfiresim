About
=====

This simulation was designed and programmed during the "Mathematische Modellierungswoche" 2010 at the Universität Hamburg by Willi Schinmeyer, Daniel Grigjanis and Bernd Lienau. It simulates wildfires.

Usage
=====

Start with bin/WaldBrandSim.exe

Simulation
----------

At the right side there are a couple of buttons and sliders. I don't think I need to explain them, except name, load and save.

If you want to save, first enter a name in the name field, then click save.

If you want to load, first enter the name in the name field, then click load.

Oh, and you can hold the Control key to make the sliders snap.

View
----

The only thing you can do in the 2D view is use the Right Mouse Button to move the camera. And edit stuff using the bar below.

Editing
-------

Select tiles at the bottom, press Num+/Num- to increase/decrease the edit radius and use left mouse to place the tiles. Right Mouse Button to cancel.
Light brown ground tiles are dry grass, dark brown tiles are earth (doesn't burn). Grey is ashes.

Known Bugs
==========

* When you click new, the global configuration is not reset.
* Not a bug, a missing feature: Resetting the fires. They are saved though, so you are advised to save before burning your forest down.

Don't use this commercially. You may edit stuff, but credit the original authors and mention that you changed things. Be fair, okay?
